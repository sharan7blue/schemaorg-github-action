# Liberty portal template i

This repo includes several packages:
1. `studio` - sanity studio

2. `tl-ph` supports configuration files (`packages/tl-ph/.env.tl-ph`, `packages/tl-ph/.env.develop`) where you can specify required env vars.

.env.development should contain sanity projectId and datataset name, e.g:

```
app_local_sanityId = "8azq2eb8"
app_local_sanityDataset = "production"
```
